Spanish spelling for single vowels is identical to IPA.

\subsection{Diphthongs}
When vowels are put next to each other one of the following this happens:\\

1. Both vowels are neither [i] nor [u], therefore are pronounced as separate syllables.\\

2. One of the vowels is [i] or [u], but has an accent mark showing its stressed and therefore are still pronounced as separate syllables.\\

3. One of the vowels is [i] or [u] and is not stressed. The vowel gets pronounced [j] (English Y) or [w] (English W) respectively.\\
